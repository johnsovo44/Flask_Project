# Flask_Project

Going to try my hand doing a Flask project using the library Flask. Flask is an easy to use framework (meaning it gets rid of all of the complex coding and jargon to make it easy to manipulate the intended functions. It's like moving a mountain with a window crank) that helps you build web apps.
